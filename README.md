# Reading the Readers: A Book Recommendation System for the Leuven Public Library

This project was developed as part of my master's thesis, aiming to create a book recommendation system for the Leuven Public Library. The system incorporates collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering recommenders to provide personalized book recommendations to the readers.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files:

`collaborative_filtering.ipynb:` This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the collaborative filtering recommender.
content-based_filtering.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the content-based filtering recommender.
hybrid_filtering.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the hybrid filtering recommender.
eda.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook includes the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the support and guidance provided by my thesis advisor and the Leuven Public Library staff during the development of this project.
